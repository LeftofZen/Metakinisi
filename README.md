# Metakinisi

A little project aimed at recreating and extending Chris Sawyer's Locomotion game, and by extension OpenLoco.

The original/OpenLoco is in C++ and has many bugs, and it difficult to extend and add new features. I aim to recreate the core gameplay in C#/Monogame and make it much more extensible and feature complete.
